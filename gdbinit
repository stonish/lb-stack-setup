# In order to step into LCG libraries, you will need to obtain the sources
# locally (make sure to use the right tag) and set up a path substitution
# such as the following
#set substitute-path /build/jenkins/workspace/lcg_release_pipeline/build/projects/ROOT-v6.24.00/src/ROOT/v6.24.00 /home/rmatev/root
#set substitute-path /workspace/build/externals/XercesC-3.2.3/src/XercesC/3.2.3 /home/rmatev/xerces-c
